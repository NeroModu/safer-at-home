# SAFER AT HOME
NeroModu's entry to Google's HackDSC 2020 Hackathon.

## Abstract
A game made in unity where the challenge is to survive as long as you can without catching the Coronavirus, where you must balance staying at home to avoid other people, with going out to acquire necessary food and health supplies.

## Inspiration
Made during the mandatory stay-at-home order imposed to fight COVID-19, our inspiration was all around us. Going outside seems scary, yet food is essential. And when you're outside, avoiding people is a must when anyone could be infected.

And with an increasing number of people becoming skeptical of the severity of this virus, we thought a playable game simulation would be a fun and informative way to show its players just how easily Coronavirus can spread.

## What it does
We used the Unity game engine to put together a small city with inhabitants (one of which is the player) as well as essential services like grocery stores and hospitals. C# scripts control the behaviours of NPCs, the player and the game mechanics.

When playing, the player must refill their health and food stats while staying away from the other human "AIs" in order to not get infected, while also keeping their money in check. Playing as a non-essential worker allows your money to regenerate while at home, and playing as an essential worker forces you to go to work to gain income. Money must be spent when visiting the grocery store or hospital.
